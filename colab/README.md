## Google Colab Notebook for training the model
This directory contains the .ipynb notebook that I used to train the TridentNet model on Google Colab. You should notice that all of the code in here is recycled from my main code in `/src`. <br> <br>
If you would like to train directly from source, you can specify pre-trained=False when running the main.py script.
